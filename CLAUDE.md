# IPTerebi

Android IPTV player. A line on an Xtream Codes panel supplies the channels; the
app supplies nothing. Phone and tablet, portrait for browsing and landscape for
playback.

## Layout

- `core/` — the panel client. URL normalisation, JSON models, HTTP, stream-URL
  building. Plain Kotlin JVM, no Android, and the only part with tests. Run them
  with `gradle :core:test`; it needs no SDK and no device, so there is no excuse
  for a change in here going untested.
- `app/` — Compose UI and the Media3 player. Nothing in here can be checked
  without a device.

Keep that line where it is. Anything that could be decided without an Android
class belongs in `core/`, because that is the half that can be proven.

## Building

**There is no Gradle wrapper, deliberately.** CI provisions Gradle 8.9 and runs
`gradle assembleDebug`. Locally you need Gradle 8.9, JDK 17 and an Android SDK
with `platforms;android-34` and `build-tools;34.0.0`.

```
gradle assembleDebug --no-daemon
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Versions move together: Kotlin, the Compose compiler plugin and the
serialization plugin are all 2.1.21 and must stay equal, because the Compose
compiler plugin is versioned with Kotlin rather than with Compose.

## Debugging on device

Debug builds log under two tags, both wrapped in `BuildConfig.DEBUG` and free in
release:

- `IPTerebiApi` — one line per panel request with the credentials stripped, and
  the status and body size that came back
- `IPTerebiPlay` — playback failures with the Media3 error code

Neither ever writes a stream URL. The credentials sit in the *path* of a stream
URL, not in a header, so a logged URL is a logged password.

## Things that are true about Xtream panels

- **"Xtream Codes" is not one implementation.** The original panel was abandoned
  in 2019 and what providers run now is a spread of forks that agree on the URL
  shape and little else. Assume every field is optional and every type is
  negotiable.
- **The same field arrives as a number from one panel and a string from the
  next.** `stream_id`, `category_id`, `num`, `max_connections` — all of them.
  This is what `FlexibleIntSerializer` and `FlexibleStringSerializer` are for.
  Strict parsing gives you an app that works against the one panel it was
  written against.
- **A rejected login is HTTP 200 with `auth: 0` in the body.** Never a 401. The
  status code tells you nothing; the body is the whole answer.
- **A suspended panel answers with an HTML page and a 200.** Anything decoding a
  response has to notice a leading `<` and say so, or the user gets
  "Unexpected JSON token at offset 0" and no idea what to do about it.
- **Some forks answer `false` to an action they do not implement.** Not `[]`,
  not an error — the literal `false`.
- **Nobody pastes a base URL.** They paste `host:port`, or a `player_api.php`
  link, or a `get.php?...&type=m3u_plus` playlist link with the username and
  password sitting in the query string. `XtreamUrl.parse` takes all of those and
  lifts the credentials out of the last two.
- **Default the scheme to http, not https.** Panels are overwhelmingly plain
  HTTP on a high port. Assuming https fails at the handshake and produces an
  error that names TLS, which sends you looking in entirely the wrong place.
- **A default user agent gets refused by a meaningful share of panels.** Every
  mainstream IPTV client identifies as VLC or ffmpeg for exactly this reason.
  The tell is a 403 on the *stream* while every API call succeeds, which reads
  as "wrong password" and is nothing of the kind.
- **`android:usesCleartextTraffic` is not optional.** From API 28 Android blocks
  cleartext by default, and nearly every panel is plain HTTP. The symptom is
  every channel failing instantly.
- **The connection limit is the most common playback failure.** A line usually
  allows one stream at a time, and the panel takes a moment to notice the
  previous connection has gone — so leaving a channel and immediately opening
  another can refuse. Some forks report it as HTTP 456, which is not a real
  status code. `describeStreamHttpError` exists to turn these into sentences.
- **`.ts` and `.m3u8` are both offered and only one may work.** Which one is a
  property of the panel, not the channel, and `allowed_output_formats` is
  aspirational — panels advertise `m3u8` and then serve a playlist that 404s.
  MPEG-TS is the safer default.
- **Live has no duration.** The seek bar stays empty and the position never
  moves. That is correct, not a bug, and the transport buttons are hidden
  because they could only ever be inert.
- **A whole channel list can be tens of thousands of entries.** Asking
  `get_live_streams` with no category is several megabytes on a large line, so
  the UI loads one category at a time and the player is navigated to with a
  stream id alone — never the list, which would end up in a Bundle.

## Working notes

Measure before concluding. The panel quirks above are guesswork made concrete;
each one is pinned by a test in `core/src/test`, and when a provider turns up
that behaves differently the test is where the new truth goes.

**`app/` compiles but has never been run.** CI builds it green and produces an
installable APK, and `core/`'s tests pass — but nothing here has ever been
pointed at a real panel or run on a phone. Everything the UI does is inference
from the API shapes, so the first session on an actual line is where the real
answers are. Expect the surprises to be in what panels return, not in whether
the code builds.
